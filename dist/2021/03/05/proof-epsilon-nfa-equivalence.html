        Abstract
      </h2>
      <p class="abstract">
        I was giving a lecture on finite automata at a club gathering, and I had to prove that non-deterministic finite automata (with $\epsilon$ transitions) are equivalent to deterministic finite automata - a well known result. However, me being the lazy bloke I am, I didn't read the textbook beforehand and tried to prove this on the spot. Needless to say it didn't go as well as it should have, and I had to postpone the proof to the next gathering. I wanted to keep the formal proof for future reference, so I decided to write a short post about it. Feel free to quote this as you like (it should be correct, but do notify me if you spot a mistake). Since this is mainly a reference for myself, I'm not going to go into detail about what a finite automaton is, what it does, etc. However I will give the usual basic definitions so that the proof can be comprehensive.

        <h2 id="dfa-in-a-nutshell">DFA in a nutshell</h2>

<p>A DFA (short for <em>deterministic finite automaton</em>) is usually stated as a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where each element is defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$Q$ - the set of all possible states. Keep in mind, a “state” in this context is not a mathematical object. From the automaton’s perspective, states need only be different from each other - it doesn’t matter what they “are”. From a human’s perspective though, it is sometimes useful to give each state an interpretation, so that we understand what the automaton is doing in an abstract sense.</li>
  <li>$\Sigma$ - the set of possible inputs to the automaton. Also called the input alphabet.</li>
  <li>$\delta: Q\times\Sigma \to Q$ - the <em>state transition function</em>, that is a mapping which, given the current state and an input, evaluates to the next state after consuming the input.</li>
  <li>$q_0 \in Q$ - the initial state of the automaton.</li>
  <li>$F \subseteq Q$ - a subset of the possible states which are considered <em>final</em> (or <em>accepting</em>). Whether a state is accepting or not depends entirely on the interpretation of the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is enough to theoretically define an automaton, but we usually introduce another definition for convenience. The <em>extended transition function</em></p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta : Q \times \Sigma^* \to Q,
$$</div>

<p>tells us the last state that the automaton enters after reading the whole input. Taking $\epsilon$ as the empty string, $w \in \Sigma^*$ and $a \in \Sigma$ we define $\hat\delta$ as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\delta(q, \epsilon) &= q, \\
\hat\delta(q, wa) &= \delta(\hat\delta(w, q), a),
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>If we call our automaton $M$ and denote the set of strings that are accepted by $M$ as $L(M)$, we can define the acceptance condition for a string $w \in \Sigma^*$ as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
w \in L(M) \overset{def}{\iff} \hat\delta(q_0, w) \in F.
$$</div>

<h2 id="nfa-in-a-nutshell">NFA in a nutshell</h2>

<p>A <em>non-deterministic automaton</em> (NFA for short) is like a DFA, except it can transition to multiple states (or none at all) for a given input. Thus the transition function is defined slithly differently</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to \mathcal{P}(Q).
$$</div>

<p>An top of this, we can also introduce $\epsilon$-transitions, that is, transitions which do not require any input ($\epsilon$ stands for the empty string, as denoted earlier). Such an NFA is given by the 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}, \delta, q_0, F)$. Naturally, we also need to modify the extended transition function as well, but before that we need another concept.</p>

<p>We call</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\Epsilon_1^*: Q \to \mathcal{P}(Q)
$$</div>

<p>the $\epsilon$ <em>closure</em> of $q$ and define it as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\Epsilon_1^*(q_1) = \{ q \in Q \,|\, \text{There is a path from } q_1 \text{ to } q \text{ that contains only } \epsilon \text{ transitions.}\}.
$$</div>

<p>We shall use this definition to define the closure for a set of states $S \subseteq Q$ as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\Epsilon^*(S) = \bigcup_{q \in S} \Epsilon_1^*(q).
$$</div>

<p>We can now (re-)define the extended transition function:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\delta : Q \times\Sigma^* &\to \mathcal{P}(Q) \\
(q, \epsilon) &\mapsto \Epsilon^*(\{ q \}) \\
(q, wa) &\mapsto \bigcup_{q_i \in \hat\delta(q, w)} \Epsilon^*(\delta(q_i, a)).
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>The acceptance condition changes as well. A single input string can be resolved to multiple end states, but we define an NFA to accept a string if even a single resolution ends in a final state. Thus, we can state this property (for an NFA called $N$ and a string $w \in \Sigma^*$) as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
w \in L(N) \overset{def}{\iff} \hat\delta(q_0, w) \cap F \neq \emptyset.
$$</div>

<h2 id="the-proof">The Proof</h2>

<p>In order to show that NFA are equivalent, we must show that all DFAs can be represented as an NFA and vice versa.</p>

<h3 id="any-dfa-can-be-represented-as-an-nfa">Any DFA can be represented as an NFA</h3>

<p>Informally, since an NFA only allows non-deterministic transitions but doesn’t require them, any DFA is trivially an NFA. This in itself should be convincing enough, but we still provide a formal proof.</p>

<p>Let $M$ be a DFA defined by the 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta_M, q_0, F)$. We construct the NFA $N$ as $(Q, \Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}, \delta_N, q_0, F)$, where</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\delta_N(q, a) = \{ \delta_M(q, a) \}.
$$</div>

<p>Furthermore, let $\hat\delta_M$ and $\hat\delta_N$ be defined as in the above sections respectively. Now we must show that $L(M) = L(N)$ which, substituting the acceptance conditions for a string $w \in \Sigma^*$, reduces to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta_M(q_0, w) \in F \iff \hat\delta_N(q_0, w) \cap F \neq \emptyset.
$$</div>

<p>This equivalence in itself is deducible from the stronger result</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta_N(q_0, w) = \{ \hat\delta_M(q_0, w) \}
$$</div>

<p>We prove the latter by induction on the length of $w$.</p>

<h4 id="basis-w--epsilon">Basis: $w = \epsilon$</h4>

<p>Simply substituting is enough (note that $N$ by definition has no $\epsilon$ transitions).</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\delta_N(q_0, \epsilon) &= \Epsilon^*(q_0) \\
&= \{q_0\} \\
&= \{\hat\delta_M(q_0, \epsilon)\}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Thus the equality holds.</p>

<h4 id="induction-wprime--wa">Induction: $w\prime = wa$</h4>

<p>Suppose that $\hat\delta_N(q_0, w) = { \hat\delta_M(q_0, w) }$ holds. We now need to show that it also holds true for $w\prime$. By substitution we get</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\delta_N(q_0, w\prime) &= \hat\delta_N(q_0, wa) \\
&= \bigcup_{q_i \in \hat\delta_N(q_0, w)} \Epsilon^*(\delta_N(q_i, a)) \\
&= \bigcup_{q_i \in \hat\delta_N(q_0, w)} \Epsilon^*(\{\delta_M(q_i, a)\}) \\
&= \bigcup_{q_i \in \hat\delta_N(q_0, w)} \{\delta_M(q_i, a)\} \\
&= \bigcup_{q_i \in \{\hat\delta_M(q_0, w)\}} \{\delta_M(q_i, a)\} \\
&= \{ \delta_M(\delta_M(q_0, w), a) \} \\
&= \{ \delta_M(q_0, wa) \} \\
&= \{ \delta_M(q_0, w\prime) \} \\
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Thus the induction step is complete and therefore</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta_N(q_0, w) = \{ \hat\delta_M(q_0, w) \}
$$</div>

<p>holds true for any string $w \in \Sigma^*$. As stated earlier, this imples that $L(M) = L(N)$.</p>

<h3 id="any-nfa-can-be-represented-as-a-dfa">Any NFA can be represented as a DFA</h3>

<p>Informally, we can show this by constructing a DFA where each state represents the collection of states that the original NFA can be in at any single point in time. For example, suppose that given an input symbol $a$, an NFA in state $q_1$ may transition to either $q_2$ or $q_3$. In our DFA, we would define a state $q_{23}$ which has an in-arrow for the input $a$ and represents the original NFA being in states $q_2$ or $q_3$ simultaneously. Since the number of states in a finite automaton is (obviously) finite, there are only a finite number (namely $ 2^{|Q|}) $ of possible “multi-states” that we can use for our DFA. Furthermore, we would define accepting states as those for which the original NFA is in at least one accepting state.</p>

<p>Below we present the formal proof.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let $N$ be an NFA defined by the 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma \cup \{ \epsilon \}, \delta, q_0, F)$. We construct the DFA $M$ as $(Q\prime, \Sigma, \delta\prime, q_0\prime, F\prime)$ with an additional injective mapping $\phi: Q\prime \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ which we call the <em>interpretation</em> of the states of $M$. Define the states of $M$ recursively as follows,</p>

<ul>
  <li>$M$ has a state $q_0\prime$ with the interpretation $\phi(q_0\prime) = \Epsilon^*(\{ q_0\})$.</li>
  <li>Let $q\prime \in Q\prime$ and $a \in \Sigma$. Then $M$ has a state $q_i\prime$ with the interpretation</li>
</ul>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\phi(q_i\prime) = \bigcup_{q \in \phi(q\prime)} \Epsilon^*(\delta(q, a)).
$$</div>

<p>Incidentally, this is also how we define $\delta\prime$, namely</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\delta\prime(q\prime, a) = q_i\prime.
$$</div>

<p>Lastly, we define the set of final states of $M$ as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F\prime = \{ q\prime \in Q \,|\, \phi(q\prime) \cap F \neq \emptyset \}.
$$</div>

<p>Thus the acceptance condition for $M$ on the input $w \in \Sigma^*$ is expressed as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
w \in L(M) \iff \hat\delta\prime(q_0\prime, w) \in F\prime \iff \phi(\hat\delta\prime(q_0\prime, w)) \cap F \neq \emptyset.
$$</div>

<p>Now we must show that $L(M) = L(N)$ or</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta(q_0, w) \cap F \neq \emptyset \iff \hat\delta\prime(q_0, w) \in F\prime
$$</div>

<p>which, using the above acceptance condition can be rewritten as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta(q_0, w) \cap F \neq \emptyset \iff \phi(\hat\delta\prime(q_0\prime, w)) \cap F \neq \emptyset.
$$</div>

<p>Again, we will actually prove the stronger result</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta(q_0, w) = \phi(\hat\delta\prime(q_0\prime, w))
$$</div>

<p>which implies the above equivalence. Similar to the proof that any DFA can be converted to an NFA, we use induction on the input string $w$.</p>

<h4 id="basis-w--epsilon-1">Basis: $w = \epsilon$</h4>

<p>Subtitute directly to get</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\delta(q_0, \epsilon) &= \Epsilon^*(\{q_0\}) \\
&= \phi(q_0\prime),
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>thus the base case holds.</p>

<h4 id="induction-wprime--wa-1">Induction: $w\prime = wa$</h4>

<p>Suppose that $\hat\delta(q_0, w) = \phi(\hat\delta\prime(q_0\prime, w))$ holds and substitute, yielding</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\delta(q_0, w\prime) &= \bigcup_{q \in \hat\delta(q_0, w)} \Epsilon^*{\delta(q, a)} \\
&= \bigcup_{q \in \phi(\hat\delta\prime(q_0, w))} \Epsilon^*({\delta(q, a)}) \\
&= \phi(\delta\prime(\hat\delta\prime(q_0, w), a)) \\
&= \phi(\delta(q_0, wa)) \\
&= \phi(\delta(q_0, w\prime)).
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>This completes the induction and thus we have proven that for any $w \in \Sigma^*$</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\hat\delta(q_0, w) = \phi(\hat\delta\prime(q_0\prime, w)),
$$</div>

<p>which implies that the acceptance conditions are equivalent and therefore $L(M) = L(N)$.</p>
